# Editor Spotlight

Simple MacOS-like Spotlight file search in Unity. It shows your most opened files first. The more you use it, the better it gets. 
This project was originally created by https://github.com/marijnz
Open thw window with Ctrl + Space on Windows or Cmd + Space on macOS.

EditorWindowExtensions.cs allows the window to be placed ion the center of the editor no matter the display it is on.

This project is not the cleanest, I would recommend forking the original repo
